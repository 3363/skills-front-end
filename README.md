# Skill Track: Front-end Web

This skill-track is an introduction to front-end web development! The term *front-end* (at least in the context of a web application) refers to the portion of a project that runs in the browser **on the user's computer**, as opposed to the *back-end* code which runs on a server computer somewhere else.

Specifically, you will write front-end code in a language called Javascript. Your Javascript code, because it runs on the user's computer, can be utilized to create a rich, interactive user experience by dynamically modifying and reacting to the HTML and CSS that make up your web page.

The course will loosely be split into two parts:
1. **Learn Javascript.** First, we will spend 2-3 weeks going over the fundamentals of Javascript, both its syntax and how to use it to modify your page's HTML and CSS. During this time, your prep -work will consist of reading from an e-book and taking a few short online classes. During in-person class time, studios will be small and self-contained.
2. **Build a Class Project.** Once you have learned the basics, we will start spending in-class studio time to build a class project together. Just like with the FlickList project from Unit 2, each studio assignment will involve adding a little bit more onto the project. In fact, we are going to build *FlickList* again! (Exciting, I know.) This version will be somewhat different than the Unit 2 version, and of course we will focus on the front-end rather than the back-end. Here is a demo of the finished product: [FlickList][flicklist-demo]. During this time, your prep-work will consist of just a few miscellaneous new concepts, but mostly you will be solidifying and getting more repetition and practice with the core concepts from part 1.
