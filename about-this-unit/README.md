This skill-track is an introduction to front-end web development.

## Synopsis

The term *front-end* (at least in the context of a web application) refers to the portion of a project that runs in the browser **on the user's computer**, as opposed to the *back-end* code which runs on a server computer somewhere else.

Specifically, you will write front-end code in a language called Javascript. Your Javascript code, because it runs in the user's browser, can be utilized to create a rich, interactive user experience by dynamically modifying and reacting to the HTML and CSS that make up your web page.

## Topics

In addition to Javascript, we will also spend some more time on few other things, such as:
- an extremely popular Javascript library called jQuery
- using Git for version control
- using CSS (and a CSS framework called Bootstrap) to create pages that actually look nice!
- writing nice, readable, "semantic" HTML code
- interacting with third-party APIs to pull in data from the real world.

## Structure of the Schedule

The course will loosely be split into two parts:

**1. Learning Javascript.** First, we will spend 2-3 weeks going over the fundamentals of Javascript, both its syntax and how to use it to interact with your page's HTML and CSS. During this time, your prep-work will consist of reading from an e-book and taking a few short online classes.

**2. Miscellaneous Skills and More Complicated Projects.** Once you have learned the basics, your prep-work will consist of a few miscellaneous new skills--such as communicating with APIs, using Bootstrap, and writing semantic HTML--but mostly you will be solidifying and getting more repetition and practice with the core concepts from part 1, by recombining those concepts in larger, more complex ways.
