In this unit, studios will take the form of ongoing running projects, just like the FlickList series in Unit 2. There will be two projects: *Mario*, and *FlickList* (again!)

## Mario

In this series, we will build and make incremental additions to a simple page that displays a "pyramid" of `#` symbols on the screen, and allows the user to specify how big to make the pyramid. This simple exercise will provide a nice, stripped down vehicle to get comfortable with the basics of Javascript syntax, and the process of writing Javascript code to interact with the user by manipulating, and responding to events from, the HTML document.

### Mario 1

Practice basic JS syntax by building a dynamically sized pyramid and printing it to the developer console.

### Mario 2

Display your pyramid for the user by inserting it into the DOM.

### Mario 3

Use an event handler callback to respond to user input and allow the user to decide the height of the pyramid.

### Mario 4

Perform client-side validation on the user's form submission.

### Mario 5

Refactor to use the jQuery library for DOM manipulation.

## FlickList

Back by popular demand, it's everybody's favorite movie app. This time, we will focus on different things, such as making a more interactive, nicer-looking user-interface, and pulling data from an API so that users can browse real movies. In order to focus in on this new material, we will limit our scope to making a static page consisting of just HTML, CSS and Javascript... in other words, "just the front-end". This means that our app will not have user accounts or the ability for users to save their lists, but we can pretend.
