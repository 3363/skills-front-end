# Class 10 Prep

Before coming to Class 10, please complete the following tasks:

### Catch Up

A Catchup is a special type of Javascript function that takes no arguments, and returns the result of an AJAX call to the Moon, unless the server on the Moon is busy, in which case the Catchup will return another function...

Just kidding. Take a few days to get caught up on previous work, such as:

- The [Pyramid Slide](../materials/assignments/pyramid-slide) assignment
- Previous FlickList studios
- Previous Prep Work items, such as the [Udacity AJAX course](../class6-prep/index.html#ajax)
- Continue working on [The AJAXson 5](../materials/assignments/ajaxson-5)
- Go back and re-read some Eloquent Javascript chapters (I suspect on the second read you will find more things [clicking into place][gif-epiphany].)
