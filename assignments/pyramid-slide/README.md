^ That's how much fun you are about to have.

## Your Task

You've been working at Mario Inc for awhile now, and during Studios you have continually iterated on your product, shipping better and better Pyramids.

Today your team's designer, Daisy, came to you with a new UI design and some new features that are surely going to take the company to the next level.

Daisy has mocked up an animation of the functionality she envisions:

Your task is to make it real!

## Setup

1. Make sure you are logged into Github.
2. Make a [new repository on Github][new-repo]. Give it the name `"pyramid-slide"`.
3. Clone your repository down onto your computer.


## Notes and Tips

A few tips before you start:

- Don't worry about styles or layout until you are done with all the functionality.
- A "slider" is actually just an `<input>` whose `type` attribute is equal to `"range"`. See [here][input-range] for more details.
- The slider event that you care about is `oninput`. See [here][oninput] for more details.
- Remember that a dropdown menu is just a `<select>` element with some `<option>` elements nested inside.
- The select event that you care about is `onchange`.
- You will need to use the following style attributes:
    - `margin`, `padding`, `color`, `background-color`, `border`, `border-radius`, `font-size`, `font-weight`

Ok, you are all set. Go make that pyramid!
